Author: Pete Barwis
Maintainer: Pete Barwis <pbarwis@capturehighered.com>
Description: This package provides functions to recode SAT scores according 
    to any table in the SAT Concordance Tables (Released 5/9/2016): this 
    includes new SAT to old SAT values, old SAT to new SAT values, new 
    SAT to ACT values, and ACT to new SAT values. All functions call 
    dplyr::recode() to perform optimized recodes. Each function accepts 
    a vector of values, recodes it, and returns the recoded vector.
